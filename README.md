# Oxide Valve controller

A Flask-based web application for Raspberry Pi that provides system monitoring, equipment control, and a RESTful API interface for scientific equipment management.
Based on the **TST Base controller** from TS Technologies.

## Features

- **Web Interface**: Browser-based dashboard for system monitoring and configuration
- **RESTfull API**: JSON-based API with authentication for programmatic control
- **System Monitoring**: Real-time CPU temperature, thread monitoring, and system status
- **Equipment Control**: Digital and analogue device control via GPIO
- **OLED Display**: Shows system information including network address and software version
- **Log Management**: Comprehensive logging with web-based log viewers
- **Configuration Management**: Web-based configuration interface for system settings

## Documentation
- **User Manual**: [manual.pdf](./manual.pdf)
- **API Documentation**: [docs/readme.md](./docs/readme.md)
- **Change Log**: [changelog.txt](./changelog.txt)


### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description                             |
|----------|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| `/api`   | POST   | Main API endpoint for equipment control |



### API Commands

Send JSON payloads with the following structure:
```
json { "item": "command_type", "command": "command_parameters" }
```

### Example Commands


#### Read Digital Channels:
``` 
json {
  "item": "digitalstatus",
  "command": false
}
```
#### Read Analogue Channels:
```
json {
  "item": "analoguestatus", 
  "command": false
}
```
## Configuration
The application supports web-based configuration for:
- Network settings
- OLED display settings
- Digital device settings
- Analogue device settings
- Log levels
- Application hostname
