[analogue_class](./analogue_class.md)  
Initializes and manages analogue-to-digital converter functionality.

This module provides functions to initialize and configure the analogue-to-digital
converter (ADC) interface, fetch individual or collective input channel values, and
validate analogue channel keys. The module ensures compatibility with ADC devices
by dynamically checking their presence and functionality at runtime.

[api_parser](./api_parser.md)  
API Parser Module

This module provides functionality for parsing and handling API control commands
related to application settings.

The module serves as an interface between API requests and the application's
configuration system, validating inputs and handling potential errors during
the parsing process.

Functions:
    parsecontrol: Process API control commands and return appropriate responses

Dependencies:
    app_control: For accessing and writing application settings
    logmanager: For logging activities and errors

[app](./app.md)  
Flask web application for Raspberry Pi system monitoring and control.

This module provides a web interface and API endpoints for monitoring and controlling
a Raspberry Pi system. It includes features for:
- System status monitoring (CPU temperature, running threads)
- Log viewing (Application, Gunicorn, System logs)
- RESTful API endpoints with authentication
- Real-time status updates via JavaScript

The application runs on Gunicorn when deployed on Raspberry Pi and includes
various endpoints for both web interface and programmatic access.

Routes:
    / : Main status page
    /statusdata : JSON endpoint for live status updates
    /api : Protected API endpoint for system control
    /pylog : Application log viewer
    /guaccesslog : Gunicorn access log viewer
    /guerrorlog : Gunicorn error log viewer
    /syslog : System log viewer

Authentication:
    API endpoints require a valid API key passed in the 'Api-Key' header.

[app_control](./app_control.md)  
Application control and configuration management for the Raspberry Pi control system.

This module manages core application configuration, settings, and version information
for the Flask-based control system. It handles loading and maintaining application-wide
settings that define crucial operational parameters.

Attributes:
    VERSION (str): The current version of the application
    settings (dict): Application-wide configuration dictionary containing:
        - app-name (str): Application identifier used in logging and display
        - api-key (str): Authentication key for API access control
        - cputemp (str): File path for CPU temperature readings
        - logfilepath (str): Path to application log file
        - gunicornpath (str): Base directory for Gunicorn log files

Note:
    This module is a central configuration point for the application and should
    be imported by other modules that need access to global settings or version
    information.

[config_class](./config_class.md)  
Application Configuration

This module provides utilities for managing system configuration, network settings, and application naming.
It serves as the core configuration interface for the Raspberry Pi control application, handling both
network interfaces and application identity management.

    - Network configuration: Get and set network interface settings (DHCP/static)
    - IP address validation: Verify IP addresses and network class formats
    - Application naming: Manage application names with automatic sanitization
    - System hostname: Update system hostname based on application name

Functions:
    friendlydirname(sourcename): Sanitizes strings by removing invalid characters
    get_netifo(): Retrieves network configuration information
    validate_ipaddress(ip_str): Validates IPv4 address format
    validate_class(class_str): Validates network class (1-32)
    set_netinfo(mode, ip_addr, nwclass, df_gw, dns_server): Configures network interface
    set_appname(name): Updates application name in settings and system hostname

Dependencies:
    subprocess: For executing system commands
    re: For regex pattern matching
    app_control: For settings management
    logmanager: For logging configuration changes

[digital_class](./digital_class.md)  
Raspberry Pi GPIO Digital I/O Control Module

This module provides a comprehensive interface for configuring and interacting with
Raspberry Pi GPIO pins. It abstracts the hardware-level details of GPIO operations
into a user-friendly class-based API, supporting both input and output operations.

Key features:
- ChannelObject class for configuring and interacting with individual GPIO channels
- Support for reading digital input values from GPIO pins
- Support for writing digital output values to GPIO pins
- Helper functions for checking digital key format and converting values
- System-wide digital channel initialization and management

The module integrates with the application's settings and logging systems to provide
consistent behavior and traceable operations across the entire application.

Dependencies:
    RPi.GPIO: For hardware-level GPIO control
    logmanager: For logging GPIO operations and errors
    app_control: For accessing application-wide settings

[logmanager](./logmanager.md)  
Logging Configuration and Management

This module provides centralized logging configuration and management for the application.
Configures logging formats, handlers, and log file management to ensure consistent
logging across all application components.

Features:
    - Standardized log formatting
    - File-based logging with rotation
    - Log level management
    - Thread-safe logging operations

Exports:
    logger: Configured logger instance for use across the application

Usage:
    from logmanager import logger

    logger.info('Operation completed successfully')
    logger.warning('Resource threshold reached')
    logger.error('Failed to complete operation')

Log Format:
    Timestamps, log levels, and contextual information are automatically included
    in each log entry for effective debugging and monitoring.

Log Files:
    Logs are stored with automatic rotation to prevent excessive disk usage
    while maintaining historical records.
